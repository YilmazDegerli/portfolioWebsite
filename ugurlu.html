            <p> <span>UGURLU Consultancy</span> is a local company focused on government incentives for firms in Turkey.</p> <br> 
                            
            <p><strong>Brief description of organization:</strong> This organization was a consulting firm focused on government incentives for companies in Turkey. The company's job description was to help companies prepare projects and submit them to the official institution. R&D center investment, hospital investment, school investment and of course factory investment etc. We were preparing projects that would receive government incentives. 15 people were working in this consultancy company.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>After the public experience in Ankara, I had to return to Istanbul, where my whole family lives. The boss of this consulting firm offered me a job. At the time, this was a very brave move because almost every company feared the government. They could have faced many hardships and punishments because of me, but the boss knew me beforehand and believed in me. I accepted her offer and worked there until I had another political problem in November 2018. In fact, I can say that I went to the other side of the table. I started helping companies prepare projects and submit them to official institutions. I led a team of 5 people.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>I organized many meetings with firms. I arranged a schedule for project and assigned tasks to people based on their strengths. When we encountered an issue during managing project, I took initiative to solve them, by determining all possible solutions and applying the best one. Finally, I reported the whole process to my superior.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>To summarize, my main tasks were to manage projects to help companies receive governmental incentives and provide advice on various investment decisions.
