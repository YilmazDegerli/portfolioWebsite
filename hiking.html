            <p> We make every month hiking with about 30 people from different nationalities thanks to this organization.</p> <br> 
                
            <p> With this project Hiking for everyone, you can attend this popular, social, and healthy leisure activity with other people. Hiking offers wonderful opportunities to make new contacts and to speak German. Everyone is invited! Don’t forget to register. Under Hikes you will find all the important information, the current hiking offers and the registration form. Contact them with any questions: wandern@isabern.ch </p> <br> 
                
            <p>They explained this project very clearly on their website as follows.
            <span>Wandern Für Alle</span> (The Hiking for All) project was created in 2016. It is based on the idea of offering a cross-thematic platform that combines health promotion and language learning with intercultural exchange.</p> <br>

            <p>Bern is the ideal place for hiking in the region. In a time of great challenges, we are on the road together and consciously take time for real encounters. We would like to promote the exchange between the local population and those who have moved here and take the opportunity to break down prejudices and misunderstandings and to learn from each other.</p> <br> 

            <p>What unites us is the joy of exercise in nature and the conviction that diversity is a great enrichment of our lives. This balance to everyday life would like to share with others. Our small excursions should also appeal to those who previously had little or no opportunity or capacity for hiking. So it is also very important to us to be on the road together with migrants and non-privileged people. We believe that this will strengthen understanding for each other and contribute to a benevolent cooperation</p> <br>
