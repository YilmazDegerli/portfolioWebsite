            <p> <span>Rem PEOPLE </span> is an international consultancy company focused on “Consumer Goods, Consumer Electronics, Telecommunication and Pharmaceutical” companies.</p> <br> 
                            
            <p>Brief description of organization: this organization is a consultancy company focused on “Consumer Goods, Consumer Electronics, Telecommunication and Pharmaceutical” companies which distribute and sell their products at physical sales points such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, department stores, shops, groceries, pharmacies, consumer electronic chains etc. The job description of the company is to disrupt the “business approach” of the works that have been done by the traditional retail-monitoring and conventional research companies for many years. There were about 200 employees in this consultancy company.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>After the political problem, I started working as a freelancer. During this time, I also applied to some companies to find a new job. This consulting firm offered me an interview. They found my experience and educational background impressive and offered me a job. I accepted their offer and worked there from December 2019 until I had to leave my country in April 2021.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>I organized many meetings within the company. I arranged a schedule for our company project and worked with the Accountants, IT Team, and Human Resources. When we encountered an issue during managing a project, I took initiative to solve them, by determining all possible solutions and applying the best one. Finally, I reported the whole process to my superior. I managed a lot of projects and thanks to these projects, my company made huge savings.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>To summarize, my main tasks were to manage projects  to  receive governmental incentives and provide advice on various investment decisions.
