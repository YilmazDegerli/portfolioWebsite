            <p><strong>Brief description of organization:</strong> Our organization is <span>Ministry of  Trade.</span>  Turkey's commercial relations with other countries, investments in the country, and all matters related to customs are managed by this ministry. I worked in the General Directorate for Incentive Implementation and Foreign Investment under this ministry.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>My duty at the Ministry was to support the investments made in the textile sector with some incentive items (tax reduction, employment support, interest support, etc.,) and to supervise these companies which received aid.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>I attended lots of meetings with firms. I made more than 100 visits within TÃ¼rkiye. I checked and approved about 1000 investment application files. I have made several presentations all around Turkey about Investment Incentives and Practices in Turkey.</p> <br> 
                
            <p>I participated in the following international organizations on behalf of my country.</p>
            <p>
                <ul class="ministry-list">
                    <li>February 2017: OECD Meetings, Paris/France</li>
                    <li>December 2015, International Fair Observation, Jakarta/Indonesia</li>
                    <li>March 2015, International Fair Observation, Cairo/Egypt</li>
                    <li>December 2013, Facility expertise in the textile sector, Rome/Italy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>I started my career in July 2012 at the Ministry of Trade and I had to leave due to political issues in May 2017. During these 5 years, I had good communication with business people and colleagues. I took responsibility when it was a difficult task which no one wanted to do. Futhermore, I helped and led the youth. I had also great coordination with other departments and was in constant collaboration with them.</p>

            <p>An example  of a challenge from those days. We once had to make a presentation in English to foreign businessmen about investment opportunities in Turkey. No one was willing to do that. Because many of them had a fear of public speaking and were not comfortable with their level of English. Actually, I was in the same situation. But then I took responsibility and did some research in a short time. I found an English presentation on this subject and updated it, then I presented and answered the questions from the audience. After this presentation, they decided to invest in Turkey. This difficult situation increased my self-confidence.</p>
