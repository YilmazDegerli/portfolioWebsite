            <p><span>Bachelor</span></p>
            <p>I worked all summer long throughout my education life. In fact, I learned my exam result while working in the industry. For this reason, I can say that my work and education have always been intertwined in my life.</p>

            <p>After 12 years of education, I took the university entrance exam in Turkey in 2006. I passed the exam as 233rd among approximately 1.6 million students. Then I chose Boğaziçi University, the best university in Turkey. All lessons at this university are in English. If you don't know English, you should go to a preparatory course. After a tough year, I started my undergraduate education in the most popular department of the university, Business Administration. I got my bachelor's degree in 2011. During these years, I tried to participate in social activities as well as lessons. I voluntarily taught mathematics to poor students. I got 95 out of 100 in the foreign language exam (YDS) held in Turkey. This score is equivalent to 114 on the TOEFL test and 8.0 on the IELTS test. I also got 96 out of 100 in the Academic Personnel and Graduate Education Entrance Exam (ALES) like the GRE in America.</p>

            <p>After graduating from university, I received job offers from 3 companies in the top 100 companies of the country, but I did not accept any of them. Since I wanted to work in the public sector, I passed the exams of many important institutions such as the Central Bank, the Stock Exchange, and the Ministry of Trade. Later, I started to work as an assistant foreign trade expert at the Ministry of Trade.</p>
                
            <p>During my undergraduate education, I took various lessons with a total of 246 ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits. Here are some examples of the lessons I have taken: Economics, Statistics, Law, Accounting, Finance, Business Policy, Bank Management, Money and Banking, Operations Management, Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, Mathematics ,Human Resources Management, and Marketing Research.</p>

            <p><span>Master</span></p>
            <p>In 2016, I started my master’s degree in finance at Gazi University (now Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli (AHBV) University) in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. However, as I realized that it would be more beneficial for my career, I changed my department to Economic Policy. After work, I went to school in the evenings and took many lessons from Finance to Economics. But, due to political reasons I could not finish my thesis and had to leave school.</p>

            <p>During my master education, I took various lessons with a total of 156 ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits. Here are some examples of the lessons I have taken: Economics, Securities and Portfolio Management, Financial Assets and Source Management, Econometry, Game Theory, and Fiscal Policy.</p>
                
            <p><span>Hörsaal Bern</span></p>                
            <p>Last semester, I enrolled in the Open Lecture Hall program of the University of Bern (Hörsaal Bern) in September 2022 and attended the following lectures as a guest student.</p>
                <p><ul class="education-list">
                    <li>Big Data Analytics</li>
                    <li>Data Science for Business Applications</li>
                    <li>Information Research Management</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>These lectures helped me decide on a new career in data analysis. Moreover, I can access all the facilities of the University of Bern thanks to this program. For example, I like to play tennis, but normally it is expensive to me. Fortunately, I can now play tennis for free whenever I want.</p>

            <p><span>Online Courses</span></p>

            <p>In addition to my education life, I always try to learn new things or deepen my knowledge on certain subjects throughout my life. Therefore, I took various courses to improve my social and technical skills. Last year I decided to change my career and did some research on other fields. Then I talked to my friends working in these fields. I compared my own abilities and goals with these career options. I decided to pursue a career in IT, specifically Data Analysis.</p>
            
            <p>I took various courses on data analysis and data science in the last 8 months (09.2022 – 05.2023) and learned SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, GIT, Tableau at the beginner level. I also took different courses to improve my social skills. I often do exercises on sites such as W3schools, Datacamp, HackerRank. I believe in life-long learning, so I continue to take online courses.</p>
                
            <p>You can find all certificates related to my continuous education in this <a href="https://github.com/YilmazDegerli/My_software_related_certificates" target="_blank">Github link</a></p>

            <p><span>Powercoders</span></p>

            <p>Powercoders was created in response to the refugee crisis of 2015. They  promote equal job opportunities for displaced talents in the IT industry. They strive to create a world in which diversity in the IT industry & beyond is a given and every talent gets an opportunity. Powercoders is a non-profit association, and their programs are self-funded and free of charge for the selected participants. You can reach more information from their website.</p>
                
            <p>After the Bern University Open lecture Hall program and the online courses, I took, I wanted to do an internship. However, I saw that obtaining work experience and certification in Switzerland is a very important issue and unfortunately the experience in Turkey will not be enough to find a job here. For this reason, I decided to develop myself in more technical subjects to be able to work in Switzerland. I wanted to enter the world of IT through this Boot Camp.</p>
                
            <p>I want to learn how to best achieve my professional goals. With their guidance, I am confident that I will have a good start in my career. Apart from the IT courses, this bootcamp also helps me develop my social skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills that apply to all jobs. After the course, I will get to know the business world in Switzerland with the opportunity of internship.</p>
                
            <p>I applied for Powercoders Bootcamp in December 2022. After some tasks and interviews, they accepted me. Our bootcamp will end at the end of June. So far, we have learned the foundations of  informatics programs such as HTML, CSS, Javascript. In addition to these technical courses, our trainers and volunteers taught us a variety of social skills. These days, they help us prepare ourselves for interviews.</p>
                
            <p>We have a very good course environment, and all participants have strong skills and impressive backgrounds. We also work here together and learn a lot about other cultures. Thanks to this training camp, we improve our English-speaking level. I want to say it again here, I am grateful to Powercoders for giving us this opportunity. For this period alone, I am happy that 29 people displaced have a chance to regain their financial independence.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I want to be one of the success stories on their website which inspires and encourages other displaced people.</p>
