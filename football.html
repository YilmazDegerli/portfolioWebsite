            <p>I like not only playing football but also watching football. Football takes place in many of the happiest, most exciting moments of my life. I remember myself playing and watching football as long as I can remember. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to play in the club in Turkey due to financial difficulties.</p> <br> 

            <p>When I came to Switzerland, I learned that the refugees in my situation were playing football matches on the weekends, and I immediately joined them. Then I looked for the possibilities of playing in the club here and I sent an e-mail to the SC Bümpliz 78 team to play in the senior league. I joined the team after a few weeks of probation. Right now, I am a member of Bümpliz 78 Football Club and play in Senior 30+ team under license. I also continue to play with my other friends on the weekends. Apart from these, I go to young boys' matches whenever I have the opportunity and as a Berner I support my team.</p> <br>
